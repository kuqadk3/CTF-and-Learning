# About me

## My promises to CTF

1. I expect not to get the answer on first try
2. I can tolerate ungodly amounts of frustation
3. I attack problems from multiple angles
4. I check my goddamn work
5. I practice persistence

Got inspired by this article : [https://medium.com/s/story/6-life-lessons-from-my-math-degree-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-math-d38aba90edfe](https://medium.com/s/story/6-life-lessons-from-my-math-degree-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-math-d38aba90edfe)
