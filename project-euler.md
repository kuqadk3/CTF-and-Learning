# Project Euler

## Problem 4

> ### Largest palindrome product
>
> #### Problem 4![](https://projecteuler.net/images/icon_info.png)
>
> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
>
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Since the limit is 10^6 which mean we only need to check 1998 numbers \([http://oeis.org/A050250](http://oeis.org/A050250)\)

So we can easily bruteforce, checking every product generated by production of three-digits number is palindrome number or not

 

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
	str_num = str(num)
	for i in range(0, len(str_num)):
		if str_num[i] != str_num[len(str_num) - i - 1]:
			return False
	return True

max = 0
max_i = 0
max_j = 0
for i in range(100, 1000):
	for j in range(100, 1000):
		product = i * j
		if is_palindrome(product) == True and product > max:
			max = product
			max_i = i
			max_j = j
print max, max_i, max_j
```

But this is practice, so i will do it in more proper way

First, i need to wrote an algorithm to generate palindrome numbers

## Problem 5

> ### Smallest multiple

> 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

```python
import math
def check_prime(n):
	for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
		if n % i == 0:
			return False
	return True

def generate_prime_array(limit):
	arr = []
	for i in range(2, limit):
		if check_prime(i) == True:
			arr.append(i)
	return arr

primes = generate_prime_array(20)

k = 20
sum = 1
for p in primes:
	exp = math.floor(math.log(k)/math.log(p))
	sum *= p**exp
print sum

## Problem 6

> ### Sum square difference
>
> #### Problem 6![](https://projecteuler.net/images/icon_info.png)
>
> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
>
> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,\(1 + 2 + ... + 10\)2 = 552 = 3025
>
> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
>
> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

```python

def calc(num):
    formula = (num * (num**2 - 1) * (3*num + 2))/12
    return formula
t = int(raw_input().strip())
for a0 in xrange(t):
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    print calc(n)

## Problem 9



> ### Special Pythagorean triplet

> #### Problem 9
>
> A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a &lt; b &lt; c, for which,a2 + b2 = c2
>
> For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.
>
> There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.  
> Find the product abc.

It's easy, brute a and then calculate b, c with each a, it will help reduce to O\(n\)

```python
#!/bin/python

import sys

def find(m):
    maximum = -1
    for a in range(3, m/2):
        c = ((a**2) + ((m - a) ** 2))/(2*(m-a))
        b = m - a - c
        if b == int(b) or c == int(c):
            if a + b + c == m and (a**2 + b**2 == c**2):
                if a*b*c > maximum:
                    maximum = a*b*c
    return maximum

t = int(raw_input().strip())
for a0 in xrange(t):
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    print find(n)
```
