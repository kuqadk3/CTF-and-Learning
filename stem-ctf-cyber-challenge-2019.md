# STEM CTF: Cyber Challenge 2019

## Foreword

After solved re50, i jump directly to re300 because i was re Golang binary once before in root-me.org and pretty confident with it. But, it turns out i was falling to rabbit hole later...and lost 14 hours just fucking around...even though i was got everything in hand at first few hours...

## Ransomware

So, basically, the challenges give us two files 

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28206%29.png)

One file is encrypted

The other is an ransomware, ELF binary

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2827%29.png)

## Stripped Golang Binary

So, first thing first

```text
root@kali:~/Desktop/tmp/stem/re300# file goldfish-ransomware-sample.exe
goldfish-ransomware-sample.exe: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, Go BuildID=K5MarkX6W5LFVyFCqnx1/TP04sI2PJcI7YBPzhARp/65gzfdXiPRtlvJMwzxMx/3eBCF1Fja7XYglCZPIra, stripped
```

So it's stripped binary, which means : 

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28230%29.png)

And golang binary contains tons of functions from tons of library, which now we dont even know any of thoses name

![](.gitbook/assets/tenor-1.gif)

So the basic idea now is, we have to identify those functions, which, we have 2 ways to do so :

* Use tools to BinDiff like diaphora to identify those functions
* Generate/Find FLIRT database for Golang

But, i dont get lucky with those 2 options, it actually identified some functions, but there are still a lot

Luckily, i found this tool :

```text
https://github.com/sibears/IDAGolangHelper
```

Install, run and choose "Rename Functions" :

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2869%29.png)

Result is pretty neat :

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28243%29.png)

## Analysis

So, if you havent analyse an golang binary before, then, main\(\) function is in main\_main\(\)

![](.gitbook/assets/tenor-2.gif)

So, firstly, the ransomware generate 24 random bytes from an hard coded bytes array and encode it by base64

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28259%29.png)

This base64 string later become your key, which will be submitted to the C&C via POST request

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28129%29.png)

So,  i just debug it to get the C&C url :

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28280%29.png)

```text
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VFZA8Cw7ednO-FzLqqesH6wd2z_bxs8-gg6L87kdVvKzkw/formResponse
```

The google forms was closed

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28139%29.png)

So if you was reading blogs about those malwares that use google forms as C&C server, or, played around with google forms a bit, you may know that you just need to change url to :

```text
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4VFZA8Cw7ednO-FzLqqesH6wd2z_bxs8-gg6L87kdVvKzkw/viewanalytics
```

To see all requests/analytics

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2843%29.png)

So, we can assume that one of those key is the key that encrypted our file, next we need to find an cipher that was used

The ransomware after sent an key to C&C, it will scan the directory

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28190%29.png)

Where

```text
/tmp/safety-folder-18972910363797880709171295166015625
```

But the golang is not terminate string by NULL byte like in C, and there is other string next to our path in memory. So, we need to extract folder name string manually, which turns out to be

```text
/tmp/safety-folder-18972910
```

Then it check extension of file

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28156%29.png)

By clicking to a1, we can see something like this

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28202%29.png)

But it's actually an memory address, which is 0x68255b, which is lstat :

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2872%29.png)

And check to see if the file is one of these extensions :

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2889%29.png)

So i just create an folder with some file to test to see if it works

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28277%29.png)

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2893%29.png)

## Triple DES - CFB mode

This part actually cost a lot of time...

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28111%29.png)

We can easily realize it use Triple DES - CFB mode to encrypt the file, we have the key, problem is i cannot find where it calculate the IV

So i wrote/got some samples program online, compile it and reverse to understand how things \(for, while, slice, array\) in golang works. For example

```text
https://www.socketloop.com/tutorials/golang-how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-with-tripledes
```

Me and some friends in @ota was tried but no luck...golang sucks!

This is all in my notes that time

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28258%29.png)

So i was trying to connect the dots, and this idea just pop out

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28235%29.png)

By playing around with some triple des code above, i have an sense that the key will be first 8 chars of key

So i just wrote an quick python script to verify my idea

```python
import base64
import time
f = open('important-file.png.enc')
content = f.read()
f.close()
s =  '''d2HwMhfXlRx2Qt/0D92mRwPuHaTdfoy0

No luck...At that moment, i thought that i was missing something when read code, so next 7-8 hours, i was trying to find the IV in code...but no one got any progress...the Go code is really sucks, flow, calling convention...was too much for my little brain...i was even tried something like :

```text
s = 'abc124209eu390wuer' //random shit
iv = s[:8]
fmt.Println(iv)
```

Even with that simple code, i couldnt find an iv after spend pretty much time on it.

So i was came back with my python script, double check, and i realize that python was fucked up the decryption

## Decryption

So what's next?

Python is not working, so easiest way is to use the language created challenge to solve the challenge

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%28136%29.png)

Actually, golang is not that bad, and pretty easy to learn, like python

{% code title="solver.go" %}
```go
package main
import "os"
import "crypto/cipher"
import "crypto/des"
//import "encoding/hex"
import b64 "encoding/base64"
import "fmt"
//import    "bufio"
//import    "io"
import    "io/ioutil"


func main() {
    b64key := os.Args[1]
    key, _ := b64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(b64key)
    d, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(os.Args[2])
    ciphertext, _ := b64.URLEncoding.DecodeString(string(d))
    block, err := des.NewTripleDESCipher(key)
    if err != nil {
      panic(err)
    }
    iv := ciphertext[:8]
    ciphertext = ciphertext[8:]
    stream := cipher.NewCFBDecrypter(block, iv)
    stream.XORKeyStream(ciphertext, ciphertext)
    fmt.Printf("%s", ciphertext)
}

```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="stimulate.py" %}
```python

DES CFB mode use first block as IV
